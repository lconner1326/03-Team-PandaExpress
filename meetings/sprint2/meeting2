Before The Next Meeting
Plans:

Minutes from Previous Meeting:
Last meeting, we had to balance our planned workload for this sprint while also figuring out the logistics for our project meeting during lab time. While we were able to get our slides done, it set us back a little bit more than we would have liked. However, we are still making good progress, as all of the pages are present with most of the functionalities; all we could really do is keep working until the deadline.
