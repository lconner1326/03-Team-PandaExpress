Meeting Agenda Items:
●	Since this is the final sprint, are we meeting the sprint deadline?

Status Update Since Last Meeting
Accomplishments:
●	 Three out of five pages are over 90% finished, and the other two are close behind, so we just need to focus more on styling than functionality for the next sprint.

Before The Next Meeting
Plans:
●	We have decided to split the frontend and backend again to see if we can be more efficient, so we need to decide who is doing what before the next sprint.

Minutes from Previous Meeting:
We had to schedule our previous meeting on a different day since Monday lab time was our presentation, so as a result we had to keep it very short. We mainly updated one another about where we were at and if we would need any help with anything.
