Status Update Since Last Meeting
Accomplishments:
●	We have made really good progress so far in that you are able to access any of the 5 pages, which each have relevant information contained in them.
●	We successfully planned out how our team presentation would look like, as well as find a room we can meet in before Monday lab time in order to rehearse/prepare for it.

Plans:
●	Our main plan is to just keep working hard and to communicate if anything goes wrong/sets you back.

Minutes from Previous Meeting:
Since this was meeting 1 for this new sprint, our previous meeting was actually the Sprint Planning Meeting from sprint 1. We kept it fairly short, mainly talking about what we would each be working on for the sprint 2. We ended up deciding to split the assignments into one person per page and see where that gets us.
